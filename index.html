<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa. I am the youngest child in my family. I have an awesome nephew whose name is Mason. He is always making me laugh, and we always have such a great time together. I currently work in the Children's department at Von Maur in Coralville at the Iowa RIver Landing. I really enjoy my job and the people with whom I work. My goal is to obtain an information systems related job after graduation. I am not positive which direction I want to go yet, but I am using this year to research.
